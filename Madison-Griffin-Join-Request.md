# Interested

I think this project implementation is interesting because you want to code in clojure and clojureScript which are languages I have been working in over the last year. I also think working on a project like this will be satisfying because it will help users find names that may have been forgotten previously. This is a worthy cause and one I would like to help accomplish.  

# Contributions

I have experience in both back-end and front-end development and have worked with clojure, clojureScript, reframe, and reitit in web development. I am good at reading documentation for things that are new. I am very interested in setting up the database and routing and would love to contribute there. However, I am flexible and can contribute anywhere you want me.

# Business

I agree that this service should be free and available to as many users as possible. I understand the limitation to FamilySearch because the services are based on the setup for FamilySearch.

# Legal

I think it is interesting that you want this project to be your project. Depending on how far we get on this project I hope you will continue it and complete it after this class. I am willing to have my contributions be under your name knowing that it will be published and used as prescribed.

# Technical

There are a lot of specifics here as to what you want to use for this project. You appear to have a very clear setup for the project and hope this will expedite the development process. I hope you are open to suggestions as we work on this project to ensure we are using frameworks that will be the most beneficial for this application. I do think these libraries are great picks, but have limited experience to know which additions are best for which applications.
